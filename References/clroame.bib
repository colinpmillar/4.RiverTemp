	abstract = {Abstract Abundance estimation is central to avian ecology. For replicated counts, Royle (2004) developed a model to estimate abundance adjusted for detectability. Hitherto, it was unknown whether the same covariate was allowed to affect both abundance and detectability. This situation was disconcerting, because relationships between abundance and such covariates describing, for example, habitat, lie at the heart of ecology. I test this by simulation and provide additional guidelines on the model as well as code to fit it in a Bayesian mode of analysis. I simulated 1,000 data sets mimicking the Swiss breeding-bird survey "Monitoring Häufige Brutvögel" (three surveys in each of 268 quadrats). Elevation affected abundance negatively and detectability positively, resulting in a hump-shaped relationship between counts and elevation. I used WinBUGS to fit the model and estimate parameters, including quadrat-specific abundance and total abundance, across all 268 quadrats. For every parameter, the model recovered estimates that showed no indication of bias. The mean error in the estimated total population size across all quadrats was only 2\%, whereas the summed maximum counts, a conventional abundance estimate, underestimated total population size by 43\%. In contrast to maximum counts, the binomial mixture model revealed the true negative relationship between abundance and elevation. This model is a promising new alternative to capture–recapture or distance sampling methods to estimate bird abundance free of distorting effects of detectability. It has perhaps the fewest requirements, needing neither individual identification nor distance information to "convert" simple counts ("relative abundance") into estimates of true abundance. It ought to be seriously considered in future bird-survey schemes. ,  Estimación de Abundancia a Partir de Conteos de Aves: Modelos Mixtos Binomiales Revelan Relaciones Covariadas Complejas Resumen.—La estimación de la abundancia es un aspecto central en la ecología de aves. Royle (2004) desarrolló un modelo para estimar la abundancia ajustada por detectabilidad para conteos replicados. Hasta entonces, se desconocía si las mismas covariables podían afectar tanto a la abundancia como a la detectabilidad. Esta situación era desconcertante debido a que las relaciones entre la abundancia y covariables que describen, por ejemplo, el hábitat, son centrales en ecología. En este trabajo evalúo esto mediante simulaciones y proveo directrices adicionales sobre el modelo y el código para ajustarlo a un modo de análisis Bayesiano. Simulé 1000 conjuntos de datos imitando el muestreo de aves reproductivas de Suiza "Monitoring Häufige Brutvögel" (tres muestreos en cada uno de 268 cuadrantes). La elevación afectó a la abundancia de forma negativa y a la detectabilidad de forma positiva, resultando en una relación en forma de joroba entre conteos y elevación. Utilicé WinBUGS para ajustar el modelo y estimar parámetros, incluyendo la abundancia específica para cada cuadrante y la abundancia total para los 268 cuadrantes. Para cada parámetro, el modelo generó estimados que no mostraron indicios de sesgo. El error promedio para el tamaño poblacional total fue sólo del 2\%, mientras que la suma de los conteos máximos, un estimado de abundancia convencional, subestimó el tamaño de la población total en un 43\%. De modo contrastante a los conteos máximos, el modelo mixto binomial reveló la relación negativa verdadera entre abundancia y elevación. Este nuevo modelo es una alternativa promisoria a los métodos de captura y recaptura o a los muestreos con distancias para estimar la abundancia de aves sin el efecto distorsionante de la detectabilidad. Este nuevo modelo tiene quizás el menor número de requerimientos, pues no necesita la identificación a nivel de individuo ni la información de distancia para "convertir" los conteos simples ("abundancia relativa") en estimaciones de abundancia verdadera. El modelo debería ser considerado seriamente en los esquemas futuros de monitoreo de aves.},

	abstract = {Relationships between species abundance and occupancy are of considerable interest in metapopulation biology and in macroecology. Such relationships may be described concisely using probability models that characterize variation in abundance of a species. However, estimation of the parameters of these models in most ecological problems is impaired by imperfect detection. When organisms are detected imperfectly, observed counts are biased estimates of true abundance, and this induces bias in stated occupancy or occurrence probability. In this paper we consider a class of models that enable estimation of abundance/occupancy relationships from counts of organisms that result from surveys in which detection is imperfect. Under such models, parameter estimation and inference are based on conventional likelihood methods. We provide an application of these models to geographically extensive breeding bird survey data in which alternative models of abundance are considered that include factors that influence variation in abundance and detectability. Using these models, we produce estimates of abundance and occupancy maps that honor important sources of spatial variation in avian abundance and provide clearly interpretable characterizations of abundance and occupancy adjusted for imperfect detection.},

	abstract = {1. Population assessment in changing environments is challenging because factors governing abundance may also affect detectability and thus bias observed counts. We describe a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating abundance corrected for detectability in metapopulation designs, where observations of ’individuals’ (e.g. territories) are replicated in space and time. We consider two classes of models; first, we regard the data as independent binomial counts and model abundance and detectability based on a product-binomial likelihood. Secondly, we use the more complex detection–non-detection data for each territory to form encounter history frequencies, and analyse the resulting multinomial/Poisson hierarchical model. Importantly, we extend both models to directly estimate population trends over multiple years. Our models correct for any time trends in detectability when assessing population trends in abundance. 2. We illustrate both models for a farmland and a woodland bird species, skylark Alauda arvensis and willow tit Parus montanus, by applying them to Swiss BBS data, where 268 1 km2 quadrats were surveyed two to three times during 1999–2003. We fit binomial and multinomial mixture models where log(abundance) depended on year, elevation, forest cover and transect route length, and logit(detection) on year, season and search effort. 3. Parameter estimates were very similar between models with confidence intervals overlapping for most parameters. Trend estimates were similar for skylark (−0.074 ± 0.041 vs. −0.047 ± 0.019) and willow tit (0.044 ± 0.046 vs. 0.047 ± 0.018). As expected, the multinomial model gave more precise estimates, but also yielded lower abundance estimates for the skylark. This may be due to effects of territory misclassification (lumping error), which do not affect the binomial model. 4. Both models appear useful for estimating abundance and population trends free from distortions by detectability in metapopulation designs with temporally replicated observations. The ability to obtain estimates of abundance and population trends that are unbiased with respect to any time trends in detectability ought to be a strong motivation for the collection of replicate observation data.},

This estimation problem arises in various unrelated contexts, such as optimal cost and production assessments in econometrics and master curve prediction in the reliability programmes of nuclear reactors. Very few constrained estimators of the support boundary of a bivariate distribution have been introduced in the literature. They are based on simple envelopment techniques which often suffer from lack of precision and smoothness. Combining the edge estimation idea of Hall, Park and Stern with the quadratic spline smoothing method of He and Shi, we develop a novel constrained fit of the boundary curve which benefits from the smoothness of spline approximation and the computational efficiency of linear programmes. Using cubic splines is also feasible and more attractive under multiple shape constraints; computing the optimal spline smoother is then formulated as a second-order cone programming problem. Both constrained quadratic and cubic spline frontiers have a similar level of computational complexity to those of the unconstrained fits and inherit their asymptotic properties. The utility of this method is illustrated through applications to some real data sets and simulation evidence is also presented to show its superiority over the best-known methods.},

	abstract = {Summary In surveys of natural populations of animals, a sampling protocol is often spatially replicated to collect a representative sample of the population. In these surveys, differences in abundance of animals among sample locations may induce spatial heterogeneity in the counts associated with a particular sampling protocol. For some species, the sources of heterogeneity in abundance may be unknown or unmeasurable, leading one to specify the variation in abundance among sample locations stochastically. However, choosing a parametric model for the distribution of unmeasured heterogeneity is potentially subject to error and can have profound effects on predictions of abundance at unsampled locations. In this article, we develop an alternative approach wherein a Dirichlet process prior is assumed for the distribution of latent abundances. This approach allows for uncertainty in model specification and for natural clustering in the distribution of abundances in a data-adaptive way. We apply this approach in an analysis of counts based on removal samples of an endangered fish species, the Okaloosa darter. Results of our data analysis and simulation studies suggest that our implementation of the Dirichlet process prior has several attractive features not shared by conventional, fully parametric alternatives.},

	shorttitle = {Conservation {Limits} for {Atlantic} {Salmon} in {Scotland}.},
	abstract = {Salmon are an important species for Scotland both in economic and conservation terms. To make informed decisions on current and future management, it is necessary to understand the health of the salmon stocks at different spatial scales and consequently the levels of mortality (e.g. fisheries, losses to marine renewable energy, predation) that can tolerated for a given set of management objectives. For salmon this is often achieved through the use of conservation limits.

Previous projects have developed conservation limits based on data collected from the North Esk. However, applying such limits throughout Scotland assumes that all Scottish rivers behave in the same way as the North Esk. Due to the range of habitats found in rivers throughout Scotland this seems to be unrealistic and likely to give spurious results and because of this SG has thus far resisted pressure to produce and use conservation limits. While a direct transfer from the North Esk is unrealistic some method for transferring conservation limits between rivers needs to be developed. 

Currently conservation limits tend to apply to the whole stock of salmon within a river. However, Scotland has noted spring runs of salmon that are not found elsewhere in Europe, enabling Scotland to have economically important spring fisheries. In addition to their economic importance spring fish are noted components of a number of SAC rivers. These spring sub-stocks appear to be doing less well than salmon returning to rivers later in the year. The use of a single river conservation limit suggested by NASCO is not appropriate as at a whole river level they may suggest that further losses may be sustainable when this may not be the case for spring fish. Methods are therefore required for producing conservation limits for spring fish.

This project will explore a number of different approaches to producing conservation limits. Current data (rod catches and a limited number of counters) will be explored to assess how conservation limits can be produced in the short term. In addition potential longer term options will be examined. Firstly the use of electrofishing data to determine the carrying capacity of different habitat types. Secondly the use of additional counters will be explored (alongside a CRF bid). Finally the use of genetics to identify areas of rivers which produce spring fish will be examined. The results of this work will inform management of salmon at a national level.},

As part of the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling Study (CLAMS), we examined how salmon-habitat potential was distributed relative to current and future (+100 years) landscape characteristics in the Coastal Province of Oregon, USA. The intrinsic potential to provide high-quality rearing habitat was modeled for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and juvenile steelhead (O. mykiss) based on stream flow, valley constraint, and stream gradient. Land ownership, use, and cover were summarized for 100-m analysis buffers on either side of stream reaches with high intrinsic potential and in the overall area encompassing the buffers. Past management seems to have concentrated nonindustrial private ownership, agriculture, and developed uses adjacent to reaches with high intrinsic potential for coho salmon. Thus, of the area in coho salmon buffers, 45\% is either non-forested or recently logged, but only 10\% is in larger-diameter forests. For the area in steelhead buffers, 21\% is either non-forested or recently logged while 20\% is in larger-diameter forests. Older forests are most extensive on federal lands but are rare on private lands, highlighting the critical role for public lands in near-term salmon conservation. Agriculture and development are projected to remain focused near high-intrinsic-potential reaches for coho salmon, increasing the importance of effectively addressing nonpoint source pollution from these uses. Percentages of larger-diameter forests are expected to increase throughout the province, but the increase will be only half as much in coho salmon buffers as in steelhead buffers. Most of the increase is projected for public lands, where policies emphasize biodiversity protection. Results suggest that widespread recovery of coho salmon is unlikely unless habitat can be improved in high-intrinsic-potential reaches on private lands. Knowing where high-intrinsic-potential stream reaches occur relative to landscape characteristics can help in evaluating the current and future condition of freshwater habitat, explaining differences between species in population status and risk, and assessing the need for and feasibility of restoration.},

More fish species were detected using benthic gillnets (mean = 72.7\%) than electric fishing (mean = 59.5\%) and pelagic gillnets (mean = 29.6\%). For all but two lakes, additional information from a local fisheries manager was required to obtain a complete list of species. Biomass data generated by standardised gillnetting and hydroacoustic surveys were not fully comparable, but a positive correlation was found. Gill netting and hydroacoustics both indicated a nearly fishless habitat below 75 m, which confirmed the maximum required fishing depth according to the European Standard EN 14757. Size distributions obtained from gillnet and hydroacoustic surveys differed statistically for large fish ({\textgreater}40 cm). Each standardised method reflected typical shortcomings. The European standard (EN 14757) should be amended for pelagic fish habitat in deep alpine lakes to include sampling effort corresponding to water volume, and additional gillnets with larger mesh sizes (e.g. 70 mm). Furthermore, the electric fishing standard (EN 14011) should be extended to incorporate requirements of lake fish sampling.},

	abstract = {Top-kriging is a method for estimating stream flow-related variables on a river network. Top-kriging treats these variables as emerging from a two-dimensional spatially continuous process in the landscape. The top-kriging weights are estimated by regularising the point variogram over the catchment area (kriging support), which accounts for the nested nature of the catchments. We test the top-kriging method for a comprehensive Austrian data set of low stream flows. We compare it with the regional regression approach where linear regression models between low stream flow and catchment characteristics are fitted independently for sub-regions of the study area that are deemed to be homogeneous in terms of flow processes. Leave-one-out cross-validation results indicate that top-kriging outperforms the regional regression on average over the entire study domain. The coefficients of determination (cross-validation) of specific low stream flows are 0.75 and 0.68 for the top-kriging and regional regression methods, respectively. For locations without upstream data points, the performances of the two methods are similar. For locations with upstream data points, top-kriging performs much better than regional regression as it exploits the low flow information of the neighbouring locations.

Riparian woodland is considered as a possible management tool for moderating future thermal conditions in streams for the benefit of fish communities. The spatial and temporal variation of stream water temperature was therefore investigated over 3 years in lowland rivers in the New Forest (southern England) to establish the suitability of the thermal regime for fish in relation to riparian shade in a warm water system. Riparian shade was found to have a marked influence on stream water temperature, particularly in terms of moderating diel temperature variation and limiting the number of days per year that maximum temperatures exceeded published thermal thresholds for brown trout. Expansion of riparian woodland offers potential to prevent water temperature exceeding incipient lethal limits for brown trout and other fish species. A relatively low level of shade (20–40\%) was found to be effective in keeping summer temperatures below the incipient lethal limit for brown trout, but ca. 80\% shade generally prevented water temperatures exceeding the range reported for optimum growth of brown trout. Higher levels of shade are likely to be necessary to protect temperature-sensitive species from climate warming. © Crown copyright 2010.},

Environmental monitoring of large river networks are based on measurement stations. Compared to the total length of river networks, their number is often limited and there is a need to extend environmental variables that are measured locally to the whole river network. The objective of this paper is to propose several relevant geostatistical models for river modelling. These models use river distance and are based on two contrasting assumptions about dependency along a river network. Inference using maximum likelihood, model selection criterion and prediction by kriging are then developed. We illustrate our approach on two variables that differ by their distributional and spatial characteristics: summer water temperature and nitrate concentration. The data come from 141 to 187 monitoring stations in a network on a large river located in the Northeast of France that is more than 5000 km long and includes Meuse and Moselle basins. We first evaluated different spatial models and then gave prediction maps and error variance maps for the whole stream network. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Some changes in the sampling technique were introduced between the periods, which impacted on the catchability. The catchability decreased with parr density, but the predictability of the regression between the density and the catchability was weak. The mean catchability over the years and sampling sites was as high as over 0.4 for fry and over 0.5 for parr which fulfilled the general criteria of proper population estimation. A three-removal electrofishing technique is considered adequately precise for a long-term monitoring.

	abstract = {Models for fish capture efficiency (catchability) using a boat-mounted AC electrofishing sampling protocol were estimated for warmwater fishes in Illinois lakes through a calibration process. Catchabilities were determined for 37 inshore zones in blocked enclosures or ponds and 5 large water bodies during fall or spring. The abundances of vulnerable fish populations were determined by census following draining or by treatment using rotenone or primacord of known catchability. Inshore catchabilities, based on a zone 0-13 m from shore, were strongly dependent on fish length (as a unimodal function), fish taxa, mean depth, and surface macrophyte cover. Under average environmental conditions, maximum catchabilities by taxon ranged from 0.0018 to 0.14 and ranked (highest to lowest) as follows: largemouth bass ? Micropterus salmoides, common carp Cyprinus carpio, crappies Pomoxis spp. in spring, shad Dorosoma spp., bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, green sunfish L. cyanellus, crappies in fall, freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, suckers (Catostomidae), and catfish (Ictaluridae). Catchabilities for common carp and shad were significantly lower in large water bodies, indicating that significant numbers were outside the inshore zone. However, the results for other species, including large samples of largemouth bass and bluegills, indicated that populations in similar whole lakes could be estimated from the predicted inshore electrofishing catchabilities in fall or spring. Strong biases in relative population density when inferred by catch per unit effort were demonstrated under differing environmental conditions. Also, estimates of ratios related to fish size, such as mortality rates, were seriously biased when based on the size structure of uncorrected catches. Therefore, catchability models are considered essential for assessing the absolute and relative attributes of fish populations across water bodies.},

	abstract = {The estimation of animal abundance is essential to understand population dynamics, species interactions and disease patterns in populations. Estimations of relative abundance classically are based on a single observation of several sites. In this case, the mapping of abundance assumes that the probability of detecting an individual, hence the sampling rate, remains constant across the observed sites. In practice, however, this assumption is often not satisfied as the sampling rate may fluctuate between sites due to random fluctuations and/or fluctuations associated with the sampling process, notably associated with the characteristics of the site. It is therefore important to account for variations in detection probability. Using a removal sampling design, we studied the performance of a Bayesian approach to estimate both sampling rates and abundance under the assumption of a closed population. The assumption of a closed population often is weakened when the number of successive samplings is large. The number of samplings has to be limited and optimal. We therefore examined the minimal number of successive samplings needed to achieve sufficient statistical accuracy while respecting underlying model assumptions. Using the same simulations, we also compared the performance of the Bayesian approach to the performance of the frequentist Hayne method based on linear regression. We show that the Bayesian approach proposed gives generally better estimations of population size than the Hayne method. The two methods give approximately the same results for the estimation of sampling rate. We then studied the variability of detection probability of Ixodes ricinus ticks sampled under several environmental conditions by using a hierarchical Bayesian model with a random effect. The estimated sampling rate τ ˆ c varied between 33.9\% and 47.4\% for shrubs and 53.6\% and 66.7\% for dead leaves. The variability of the sampling rate due to the site decreased when the number of successive samplings considered in the model increased. The variability was lower in dead leaves than shrubs. This approach could be used routinely for ecological or epidemiological studies of ticks and species with comparable life histories.},

We first establish that the Carle \&amp; Strub method provides a more robust estimate of population abundance than the Zippin and Seber methods. We then show how prior information on capture probability may be used to improve the accuracy of the abundance estimate in open sites. We also show that the use of prior information with single-pass electrofishing may improve the accuracy of the abundance estimate so that it is comparable with that of multi-pass electrofishing in terms of stock prediction while requiring less sampling effort.},

	abstract = {The author compares 12 hierarchical models in the aim of estimating the abundance of fish in alpine streams by using removal sampling data collected at multiple locations. The most expanded model accounts for (i) variability of the abundance among locations, (ii) variability of the catchability among locations, and (iii) residual variability of the catchability among fish. Eleven model reductions are considered depending which variability is included in the model. The more restrictive model considers none of the aforementioned variabilities. Computations of the latter model can be achieved by using the algorithm presented by Carle and Strub (Biometrics 1978, 34, 621–630). Maximum a posteriori and interval estimates of the parameters as well as the Akaike and the Bayesian information criterions of model fit are computed by using samples simulated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The models are compared by using a trout (Salmo trutta fario) parr (0+) removal sampling data set collected at three locations in the Pyrénées mountain range (Haute-Garonne, France) in July 2006. Results suggest that, in this case study, variability of the catchability is not significant, either among fish or locations. Variability of the abundance among locations is significant. 95\% interval estimates of the abundances at the three locations are [0.15, 0.24], [0.26, 0.36], and [0.45, 0.58] parrs per m2. Such differences are likely the consequence of habitat variability.},

The objective of this research is to implement a methodology that incorporates a river metric into the space/time analysis of dissolved oxygen data for two impaired river basins. An efficient algorithm is developed to calculate river distances within the BMElib statistical package for space/time geostatistics. We find that using a river distance in a space/time context leads to an appreciable 10\% reduction in the overall estimation error, and results in maps of DO that are more realistic than those obtained using a Euclidean distance. As a result river distance is used in the subsequent non-attainment assessment of DO for two impaired river basins in New Jersey.},

To inform this decision, we propose a supplement to the hierarchical Bayesian models recently introduced for the analysis of depletion data.

	abstract = {Total biomass of fish populations has traditionally been computed by multiplying the mean weight of captured fish by the estimated abundance of fish. The variance estimator for this method overestimates variance when a moderate to large portion of the population is sampled. We developed and evaluated finite population correction (FPC) methods for estimating fish biomass in small streams ({\textless}5 m wetted width) in conjunction with removal population estimators. Using simulated data we found that removal estimates could deviate by more than 50\% from true population abundances and be biased when the ratio of total captured fish to the estimated abundance was less than 0.6. These deviations were generally not biased and within 25\% of the true population when the ratio was 0.6 or higher. To estimate biomass using FPC methods we investigated a classical a priori sample design and an a posteriori modeled estimator. Both methods take advantage of the fact that relatively high proportions of total populations are typically captured (and can be weighed) in small streams during removal estimates. The a posteriori model-based method can be used to partition estimates of variance and incorporate measurement error, but the a priori design cannot. Estimates of biomass using all three methods were identical. However, precision of FPC methods was significantly better (Wilcoxon paired sign-ranked test: P {\textless} 0.001) than the traditional method. Coverage by 95\% confidence intervals for the model-based FPC method were much closer to the 95\% nominal level than for the traditional method, especially when capture probabilities were higher than 0.5. We recommend using the model-based FPC method because it reduces estimates of SE as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (N) and it provides the most reliable 95\% confidence intervals.

The model also uses the data from all sites to estimate the population size at each individual site. This results in generally improved precision for multiple-pass sites and provides comparable estimates from single-pass sites.

The model is based on the assumption that in the removal sampling, catchability may vary between individuals, which appears to be necessary for a realistic description of many biological populations. Heterogeneous catchability among individuals leads to a situation where the mean catchability in the population gradually decreases as the number of removals increases. Under this assumption, the model can be fitted to any removal data, i.e., there are no limitations regarding the total catch, the number of removals, or the decline of the catch. Using a published data set from removal experiments of a known population size, the model is shown to be able to estimate the population size appropriately in all cases considered. It is also shown that regardless of the statistical approach, a model that assumes equal catchability of individuals generally leads to an underestimation of the population.

Une capturabilité individuelle hétérogène engendre une situation dans laquelle la capturabilité moyenne de la population décroît graduellement à mesure que le nombre de retraits augmente.

In order to deal with the relative sparseness of the monitoring locations in comparison to the number of locations where one might want to make predictions, we make a classification of the river and stream locations. We then implement optimal spatial prediction (ordinary and constrained kriging) from geostatistics. Because of their directed-tree structure, rivers and streams offer special challenges. A complete approach to spatial prediction on a river network is given, with special attention paid to environmental exceedances. The methodology is used to produce a map of Dochange predictions for 2003. Dochange is one of the variables measured as part of the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program conducted within the Moreton Bay Waterways and Catchments Partnership.},

The assumptions of the removal method are that changes in population size occur only through capture, and the probability of capture is equal for all individuals in a population during the removal sequence. A modification of the multinomial model is proposed and a new estimator developed. In the new model the likelihood density of the probability of capture is weighted with a beta prior. The case where α = β = 1 (uniform prior) is compared with ML estimation and found to have lower bias and variance. The new method, unlike previous methods, does not fail for any catch vector thus avoiding the substitution of the total catch for the estimate of N when infinite estimates occur. The assumptions that result from applying large sample theory while estimating the variance of ML estimates are reviewed, and a condition presented for the inadequacy of asymptotic variance formulae when using the weighted estimator (α = β = 1). Examples illustrating the use of the new method are given; one example illustrates the use of the new method when previous methods fail. Various assumption violations are investigated and the new method is found to be more robust against the violation of assumptions than previous methods.},

The data set consists of 10 sampling sites sampled by one or two removals over a period of 20 years (1986–2005). We develop and contrast four models to assess the effect of temporal variations and habitat type on the density of fish and the probability of capture. The Bayes factor and the deviance information criterion are used to compare these models. The most credible and parsimonious model is the one that accounts for the effects of the years and the habitat type on the density of fish.

Secondly, the modelled river network generated explanatory variables for every site in the network, facilitating the mapping of predicted densities and providing the basis for stratified or regression estimators for reach-specific densities.

	abstract = {The distributions and abundances of trout and salmon are strongly influenced by their habitat. The habitat includes both abiotic and biotic factors, which interact in complex webs. Habitat probably has strongest effects during population bottlenecks, when the standing stock approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. Various approaches to modelling interactions between habitat and population density and mean weight have been explored, but further work is needed in this area of investigation. The importance of depth, current, substrate, cover, and to a lesser extent, temperature and oxygen availability to the various stages of the life cycles of salmon and trout are briefly reviewed. By drawing on published data, it is possible to define broad ranges of acceptable conditions for the life stages of each species. However, it is not possible to partition this variation into between-population differences, within-population preferences, within-population tolerances, and effects of interactions between habitat variables. To pursue this important issue further, a structured approach using experimentation both in the field and in suitable laboratory systems is recommended. There is abundant evidence that habitat requirements of salmon and trout overlap. Trout tend to out-compete salmon except often in areas of particularly fast flows and, perhaps, remote from the river bank. The habitat requirements of year classes of salmon and trout overlap and therefore, there is scope for interactions between them depending on the spatial arrangement of habitats and the occurrence of bottlenecks. It is particularly important to understand where the bottlenecks to production lie and to focus on these in the first instance. Otherwise, there is a risk of manipulating habitat that is already in excess, or increasing numbers of a population that will subsequently be constrained, e.g., by over-wintering habitat. For this reason, it is prudent to accept that although manipulations of habitat may appear to be beneficial when considered locally, they should be measured and assessed where possible in terms of the production of returning adults and/or high quality smolts. Because of the complexity of interactions between salmon, trout, and the animals that eat them, it is at present difficult, or impossible, to derive good predictive models of the effects of manipulating habitats under many circumstances.},

We explain and exploit the equivalence of N-mixture and multivariate Poisson and negative-binomial models, which provides powerful new approaches for fitting these models. We show that particularly when detection probability and the number of sampling occasions are small, infinite estimates of abundance can arise. We propose a sample covariance as a diagnostic for this event, and demonstrate its good performance in the Poisson case. Infinite estimates may be missed in practice, due to numerical optimization procedures terminating at arbitrarily large values. It is shown that the use of a bound, K, for an infinite summation in the N-mixture likelihood can result in underestimation of abundance, so that default values of K in computer packages should be avoided. Instead we propose a simple automatic way to choose K. The methods are illustrated by analysis of data on Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni.},

	abstract = {Summary.  Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association80, 423–426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

In this paper the likelihood function for distributions is used to define a likelihood ratio function for distributions. It is shown that this empirical likelihood ratio function can be used to construct confidence intervals for the sample mean, for a class of M-estimates that includes quantiles, and for differentiable statistical functionals. The results are nonparametric extensions of Wilks's (1938) theorem for parametric likelihood ratios. The intervals are illustrated on some real data and compared in a simulation to some bootstrap confidence intervals and to intervals based on Student's t statistic. A hybrid method that used the bootstrap to determine critical values of the likelihood ratio is introduced.},

	abstract = {Because elevated levels of water-borne Escherichia coli in streams are a leading cause of water quality impairments in the U.S., water-quality managers need tools for predicting aqueous E. coli levels. Presently, E. coli levels may be predicted using complex mechanistic models that have a high degree of unchecked uncertainty or simpler statistical models. To assess spatio-temporal patterns of instream E. coli levels, herein we measured E. coli, a pathogen indicator, at 16 sites (at four different times) within the Squaw Creek watershed, Iowa, and subsequently, the Markov Random Field model was exploited to develop a neighborhood statistics model for predicting instream E. coli levels. Two observed covariates, local water temperature (degrees Celsius) and mean cross-sectional depth (meters), were used as inputs to the model. Predictions of E. coli levels in the water column were compared with independent observational data collected from 16 in-stream locations. The results revealed that spatio-temporal averages of predicted and observed E. coli levels were extremely close. Approximately 66 \% of individual predicted E. coli concentrations were within a factor of 2 of the observed values. In only one event, the difference between prediction and observation was beyond one order of magnitude. The mean of all predicted values at 16 locations was approximately 1 \% higher than the mean of the observed values. The approach presented here will be useful while assessing instream contaminations such as pathogen/pathogen indicator levels at the watershed scale.},

In this study we hypothesized that the altitude of the spawning site is positively related to the migration effort.
* 2Life-history theory predicts (i) that the equlibrium egg density, which is a fitness measure, thereby will decline more rapidly with altitude in migratory than in stream-resident populations, and therefore (ii) that residency will be selected for at large enough altitudes.
* 3As the density of juveniles is a function of egg density, we hypothesized that (a) altitude has stronger effect on juvenile density in migratory than in resident populations, and (b) juvenile density is larger in migratory than in resident populations.
* 4We tested (a) and (b) using multivariate methods for electrofishing data from 164 sea-migratory and 167 stream-resident populations of brown trout Salmotrutta L. in Sweden. Both predictions were supported; the juvenile density was larger and declined more rapidly with altitude in migratory than in resident populations.

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is an intrinsic characteristic in freshwater stream environments where nested watersheds and flow connectivity may produce patterns that are not captured by Euclidean distance. Yet, many common autocovariance functions used in geostatistical models are statistically invalid when Euclidean distance is replaced with hydrologic distance. We use simple worked examples to illustrate a recently developed moving-average approach used to construct two types of valid autocovariance models that are based on hydrologic distances. These models were designed to represent the spatial configuration, longitudinal connectivity, discharge, and flow direction in a stream network. They also exhibit a different covariance structure than Euclidean models and represent a true difference in the way that spatial relationships are represented. Nevertheless, the multi-scale complexities of stream environments may not be fully captured using a model based on one covariance structure. We advocate using a variance component approach, which allows a mixture of autocovariance models (Euclidean and stream models) to be incorporated into a single geostatistical model. As an example, we fit and compare "mixed models," based on multiple covariance structures, for a biological indicator. The mixed model proves to be a flexible approach because many sources of information can be incorporated into a single model.},

	abstract = {We present an application of Bayesian hierarchical modelling of stock–recruitment (SR) relationships aiming at estimating Biological Reference Points (BRP) for European Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks. The structure of the hierarchical SR model developed distinguishes two nested levels of randomness, within-river and between rivers. It is an extension of the classical Ricker model, where the parameters of the Ricker function are assumed to be different between rivers, but drawn from a common probability distribution conditionally on two covariates: river size and latitude. The output of ultimate interest is the posterior predictive distribution of the SR parameters and their associated BRP for a new river with no SR data.
The flexible framework of the Bayesian hierarchical SR analysis is a step towards making the most comprehensive use of detailed stock monitoring programs for improving management advice. Posterior predictive inferences may be imprecise due to the relative paucity of information introduced in the analysis compared to the variability of the stochastic process modeled. Even in such cases, direct extrapolation of results from local data-rich stocks should be dismissed as it can lead to a major underestimation of our uncertainty about management parameters in sparse-data situations. The aggregation of several stocks under a regional complex improves the precision of the posterior predictive inferences. When several stocks are managed jointly, even imprecise knowledge about each component of the aggregate can be valuable. The introduction of covariates to explain between stock variations provides a significant gain in the precision of the posterior predictive inferences. Because we must be able to measure the covariates for all the stocks of interest, i.e. mostly sparse-data cases, the number of covariates which can be used in practice is limited. The definition of the assemblage of stocks which we model as exchangeable units, conditionally on the covariates, remains the most influential choice to be made when attempting to transfer information from data-rich to sparse-data situations.},

In light of the advantages of the capture-recapture robust design, a similar sampling scheme is of interest in the catch-effort estimation framework. Here a description of the robust design for catch-effort methods is provided, complete with explicit maximum likelihood estimators for a range of open models. The presence of mortality and recruitment are handled in the model development sequentially. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the performance of maximum likelihood estimators under the robust design in comparison with a previously defined regression estimator. The robust design provided for greater model flexibility and in almost all circumstances produced maximum likelihood estimators that were superior to those estimated by regression methods. The advantages of the robust design are discussed for a variety of modeling scenarios.},

	abstract = {We used hierarchical linear regression to examine relationships between brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) density and habitat features nested at three levels: sections within reaches, reaches within streams, and streams within a basin. Brook trout density and environmental variables were quantified at 600 stream sections distributed among 120 reaches and 22 streams in the Cascapedia River basin, Quebec, Canada. Decomposition of variance showed that variation in density among streams was small relative to that among sections or reaches and not statistically significant. Density was influenced by habitat variables at both the section (current velocity, woody debris, cover) and reach (subbasin area, height increment at flood, valley width) levels. A cross-level interaction between current velocity and subbasin area pointed to a "contextual" effect: density showed stronger decline with current velocity in larger subbasins than in smaller subbasins. This result suggests that there was no single "best scale" ..., La régression linéaire hiérarchique nous a permis d'examiner les relations entre la densité d'ombles de fontaine (Salvelinus fontinalis) et les caractéristiques environnementales emboîtées à trois niveaux hiérarchiques : les sections à l'intérieur des tronçons, les tronçons à l'intérieur des tributaires et les tributaires à l'intérieur d'un bassin. Nous avons échantillonné les poissons et les variables environnementales dans 600 sections réparties sur 120 tronçons et 22 tributaires de la rivière Cascapédia (Québec), Canada. La décomposition de la variance montrait que la variation de la densité entre tributaires n'était pas significative et était plus faible que celle entre sections ou entre tronçons. La densité était influencée par des caractéristiques environnementales aux niveaux des sections (vitesse du courant, débris ligneux, couvert) et des tronçons (superficie du sous-bassin, augmentation de la hauteur à la crue, largeur de la vallée). L'interaction entre la vitesse du courant et la superficie du ...},

	abstract = {Evidence that drainage basin morphology and trout standing stock are related through a functional link between geomorphic features and stream habitat quality is presented. Numerous significant univariate correlations were found between geomorphic variables, stream habitat variables, and trout standing stock in both high-elevation forest and low-elevation rangeland streams. Canonical correlations between geomorphic variables and stream habitat variables provided insight into the form of the functional link. Multiple-regression equations predicting trout standing stock were dominated by geomorphic variables. When geomorphic variables alone were incorporated into regression models they predicted trout standing stock as accurately as did stream habitat variables.},

This theory is easily extended to open population models for multiple-recapture data. Estimation is based on a log-linear model developed for modeling dependent capture-recapture data when capture probabilities vary temporally with behavioral response and are heterogeneous among animals. Models for complete capture history data are developed along with the first log-linear models for removal data. The maximum likelihood estimator of the model parameters along with the estimated covariance matrix are presented.},
